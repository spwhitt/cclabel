cclabel
=======

Python implementation of connected componenet labeling for binary images.

Algorithm is based heavily on [Optimizing Two-Pass Connected-Component Labeling by Kesheng Wu, Ekow Otoo, and Kenji Suzuki](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1529869&preflayout=flat)

Any errors in the implementation are soley my fault.

To see it in action, just run ./cclabel example.png

Further details are in the source
